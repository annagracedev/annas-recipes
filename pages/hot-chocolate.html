    <h1>Hot Chocolate</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Hot chocolate is named differently from my <a href="hot-cocoa.html">hot cocoa</a> recipe because it uses whole chocolate.</p>
      <p>This is one of my very favorite things in the world. Unsweetened hot chocolate tastes just like I had imagined coffee would taste as a girl, and unlike coffee, it doesn&#8217t generally bother my stomach, so I can have it any time.</p>
      <p>The texture of hot chocolate made with whole chocolate is very different from hot cocoa made with cocoa powder. It is more of a European style hot chocolate. You can restore the emulsion by heating it up in the double boiler again.</p>
      <p>I think making ganache first really does make the recipe less prone to seizing (even when pouring cold milk on top!) and with a richer texture.</p>

    <h2>Requires</h2>
    <ul><li>Double boiler</li></ul>
    <h2>Makes</h2>
    <p>1 serving</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 oz unsweetened baking chocolate</li>
      <li>100ml heavy cream</li>
      <li>250ml milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a double boiler, make ganache with the chocolate (no need to chop) and cream. If the ganache isn&#8217t coming together, stop whisking and let it heat up for longer.</li>
      <li>Pour the milk (it can be cold) over the top of the ganache. Do not stir! Cover the double boiler and let it heat back up until the milk is hot and steaming. Then whisk it all together again. If the chocolate begins to split, stop and let it heat up more before stirring again.</li>
