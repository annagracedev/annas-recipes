    <h1>Bannocks</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>I did a little genealogical research some time ago and discovered that the earliest ancestors I can trace on my father&#8217s side of the family were Scottish. Is that why I have an affinity for these bannocks? Who knows! They are probably not the most traditional bannocks, but they&#8217re one of the few bread-like recipes I know of which can be made naturally gluten-free.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredient-list">
      <ul>
        <li><label class="ingredient"><input type="checkbox"><span class="checkmark">1 1/3 cups (about 300g) ground oats (oat flour)</span></input></label></li>
        <li><label class="ingredient"><input type="checkbox"><span class="checkmark">1 tsp baking soda</span></input></label></li>
        <li><label class="ingredient"><input type="checkbox"><span class="checkmark">180ml buttermilk (plus more, if needed)</span></input></label></li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I like to make my own oat flour in a blender. The oats can be ground as roughly or as finely as you like.</li>
      <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir thoroughly to combine. You may need more or less buttermilk depending on the ambient hydration level of your oats. If you prefer your bannocks more on the crumbly side, use less buttermilk. At this point, you can refrigerate the dough for a little while to slow the baking soda reaction while it hydrates and becomes easier to shape.</li>
      <li>Preheat your cast iron skillet over low to medium-low heat. Cooking the bannocks on too high of a temperature results in the crust browning prematurely.</li>
      <li>Shape the dough into 8 round cakes and cook them 4 at a time, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown.</li>
