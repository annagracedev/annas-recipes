    <h1>Potatoes au Gratin</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>At first every recipe for potatoes au gratin that I tried was a complete flop. All of them attempted to cook the potatoes from raw in the oven, and none of them worked out of the box with my environment variables. Then I looked up how French home cooks would make this dish and discovered the easy way to make potatoes au gratin. It&#8217s incredibly simple.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Requires</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pot which retains heat well, such as a Dutch oven</li>
      <li>Cast iron skillet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs yellow potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>200ml heavy cream</li>
      <li>250ml whole milk (plus more, if needed)</li>
      <li>1 tsp nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tsp thyme</li>
      <li>8 oz cheese, shredded (such as gruy&egravere, Swiss, or white cheddar; a combination works well)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
      <li>In a medium sized pot, combine the milk and cream. (An enameled cast iron pot is good, but I use my grandmother&#8217s enameled steel cookware and have no trouble at all. Stainless steel or nonstick does not cook as evenly, so the potatoes may take longer to cook in those.)</li>
      <li>As you finish cutting them, add the garlic, onion, and sliced potatoes to the cold dairy. Add milk if necessary to just cover the potatoes. Add nutmeg and thyme and bring to a gentle boil. Cook until the potatoes are soft and easy to pierce with a knife. This time will depend on how thinly your potatoes are sliced, but 15 minutes is a good starting point.</li>
      <li>Layer the potato mixture in a cast iron skillet (or a casserole dish, but I prefer the texture from using cast iron) and layer the cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and crispy around the edges.</li>
    </ol>
