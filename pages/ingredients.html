        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      </div>
        <p>I try to cook with ingredients I can source locally, and there are a few considerations I have for my diet. I&#8217m glad that the state of gluten-free food has improved so drastically from what it was when my mom developed Celiac disease.</p>
      <div class="title">
        <h2>Water</h2>
      </div>
        <p>I use filtered water for everything in my kitchen. Tap water bothers my digestion. I tested this at multiple locations across the country and I&#8217ve found it to be consistently true. A carbon water filter seems to be sufficient in removing whatever causes it. Maybe it&#8217s chlorine.</p>
      <div class="title">
        <h2>Flour</h2>
      </div>
        <p>I&#8217ve used King Arthur gluten-free all-purpose flour mix as a straight replacement for wheat flour in almost every recipe I make. In my opinion, of two commonly available gluten-free flours in my area, it&#8217s the superior choice for baked goods, while Bob&#8217s Red Mill gluten-free mix is superior for absorbing fat in a roux. However, it&#8217s not a significant enough difference for me to go out of my way to choose one or the other. Better results can be obtained by making custom gluten-free flour mixes for different recipes, but frankly, I do not have enough space or time in my life for that. I think that in most cases, a pre-made mix is about 80% as good, and techniques and seasoning are more important to obtaining a good result than the specific flour replacement used.</p>

        <h2>Soy Sauce</h2>
      </div>
        <p>Most soy sauce contains wheat, so if you are cooking gluten-free food you must be careful to buy gluten-free soy sauce.</p>
      <div class="title">
        <h2>Mirin</h2>
      </div>
        <p>Mirin contains quite a bit of sugar. There&#8217s really no substitute for mirin. I seem to tolerate sugar fine in small doses, so I cook with mirin without worrying about it.</p>
      <div class="title">
        <h2>Milk</h2>
      </div>
        <p>I use lactose-free whole milk for all my cooking. Thankfully, I tolerate many other forms of dairy well. I have never noticed a difference between using milk or lactose-free milk in any recipe, so I don&#8217t normally specify it.</p>
