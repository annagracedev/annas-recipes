    <h1>Maple Peanut Truffles</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>After I had mentioned offhandedly that I would bring some chocolates to a small party, I panicked internally because unsweetened chocolate is not to the tastes of most people. So instead of making chocolate truffles with ganache as planned, I grabbed a jar of peanut butter and made something like my version of peanut butter cups. Have you noticed that peanut butter becomes more viscous when mixed when a sweetener like honey or maple syrup? This filling needed to be mixed with cornstarch to hold up well, but it was a good starting point. I kept these truffles in the fridge right up until serving. I do not think anyone noticed that there was no sugar in the chocolate coating itself...</p>

    <h2>Makes</h2>
    <p>1-2 dozen</p>
    <h2>Requires</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Double boiler</li>
      <li>Baking sheet</li>
      <li>Parchment paper</li>
      <li>Freezer space</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 16 oz jar natural peanut butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste (optional)</li>
      <li>2-3 Tbsp cornstarch (depending on the consistency of your peanut butter)</li>
      <li>4 oz baking chocolate (plus more, if needed)</li>
      <li>Sea salt for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla, and cornstarch in a small bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Using a spoon (I used a 2 tsp measuring spoon), form the filling into balls (it made about 20). Place on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and freeze for at least 30 minutes, until very cold.</li>
      <li>Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and transfer it into a small bowl to make the next step easier. (I did not temper my coating because I was feeling lazy. Temper it with a small amount of coconut oil if you like.)</li>
      <li>Using a large metal spoon, transfer one truffle at a time into the melted chocolate, turn it to coat completely, then transfer it back onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle a generous pinch of sea salt across the top.</li>
      <li>Return the baking sheet to the freezer and the chocolate to the double boiler to refreeze and reheat them as needed throughout this process.</li>
      <li>After the chocolate coating has completely set, these truffles can be stored in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
