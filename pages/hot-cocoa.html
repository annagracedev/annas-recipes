    <h1>Hot Cocoa</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Hot cocoa is named differently from my <a href="hot-chocolate.html">hot chocolate</a> recipe because it uses cocoa powder.</p>
      <p>The high fat content in hot chocolate doesn&#8217t usually bother me, but sometimes I want something a little lighter. I also sometimes want to flavor my drink with a lavender infusion, which is a bit tricky with a chocolate-based recipe (the milk must be simmered while the lavender steeps in it, and the resulting flavor profile is different, as the volatile compounds which are fat-soluble seem to taste different from the water- or alcohol-soluble ones).</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Makes</h2>
    <p>1 serving</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
      <li>Pinch ground spices, optional (e.g. cayenne pepper, cinnamon, or nutmeg)</li>
      <li>100ml boiling water (you can infuse this water with herbs or flavorings first)</li>
      <li>250ml milk, warmed</li>
      <li>Pinch salt (I like sea salt)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a mug, pour the boiling water over the cocoa powder and any spices and whisk thoroughly. The best tool for getting rid of lumps in a cocoa slurry that I have found is a chasen. I even use mine for this purpose more often than for preparing matcha. However, stirring a little longer with a spoon is usually good enough.</li>
      <li>Add hot milk and stir. If you like very bitter chocolate, you can stop here. If not, add your pinch of salt to balance the bitter flavor. Then taste! Every salt is different, and it only takes a small amount before it can become unpleasantly (or not, if you want a hot electrolyte drink) salty. Only add a small amount of salt at a time and taste.</li>
    </ol>
