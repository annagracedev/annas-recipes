      <p>Hi! I&#8217m Anna. For those of you who don&#8217t know me (how did you find this site?), this is my recipe collection. I grew tired of switching Obsidian vaults between journal and recipes on my phone, so I decided to make a simple website which I can reference while I cook.</p>
      <p>I&#8217ve always loved to cook and bake. I enjoy trying new recipes from many different cuisines, but only those which I can perfect with easily obtainable ingredients make it into my collection. I continually refine my recipes and update them from time to time.</p>
      <p>In 2024 my digestive system had a breakup with food. I completely changed my diet to help manage my health. As a result, these recipes are specifically tuned to be things that I can eat. My recipes are all gluten-free and free of tree nuts. I avoid refined sugar whenever possible, and sometimes I don&#8217t use sweeteners at all. Since I&#8217ve experienced new reactions even to previously safe foods, recipes may change or be removed unexpectedly.</p>
      <p>What you <em>can</em> expect to find, at present: meat, dairy, peanut, coconut, and chocolate, which is its own food group.</p>
      <p>Whether you also have a laundry list of food sensitivities to work with or you just want to cook good food, I hope you enjoy my recipes!</p>
