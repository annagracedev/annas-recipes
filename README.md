# annas-recipes

Welcome to my "Hello, world" web dev project: a simple static website meant for me to store my own recipes. It is also a playground for my adventures in learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You are free to link to, modify for personal use, and cook (naturally!) anything you find here, but you do not have permission to redistribute my content.
