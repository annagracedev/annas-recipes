    <h1>Maple Peanut Truffles</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>After I had mentioned offhandedly that I would bring some chocolates to a small party, I panicked internally because unsweetened chocolate is not to the tastes of most people. So instead of making chocolate truffles with ganache as planned, I grabbed a jar of peanut butter and made something like my version of peanut butter cups. Have you noticed that peanut butter becomes more viscous when mixed when a sweetener like honey or maple syrup? I kept these truffles in the fridge right up until serving. I do not think anyone noticed that there was no sugar in the chocolate coating itself...</p>

      <li>Double boiler</li>
      <li>Baking sheet</li>
      <li>Parchment paper</li>
      <li>Candy thermometer (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Separate the peanut butter by pouring off the oil which rises naturally to the top at room temperature, and save the oil for another use.</li>
      <li>Combine peanut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla (if using) in a small bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
      <li>Using a spoon (I used a 2 tsp measuring spoon, leveled), form the filling into balls. Place on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Temper the chocolate in a double boiler. First melt 8 oz chocolate in a double boiler. I heated it to about 118F, which worked out well. Turn off the heat. Break up the remaining 4 oz of chocolate into smaller pieces. Add them to the melted chocolate and stir until the temperature cools to 85F. Turn the heat back on very low until the temperature of the chocolate rises back to right around 90F. This temperature should be maintained throughout the rest of the process. I found that leaving it in the double boiler on the lowest heat possible worked for me. If you are feeling lazy, you don&#8217t have to temper the chocolate. Heat it in the double boiler until it is just barely melted and continue. The tempering may not survive this. However, it&#8217s more than fine to eat.</li>
      <li>Using two forks, transfer one truffle at a time into the melted chocolate, turn it to coat completely, then transfer it back onto the baking sheet. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt across the top.</li>
      <li>After the chocolate coating has completely set, these truffles can be stored in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
