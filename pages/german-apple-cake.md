# German Apple Cake
Still workshopping this recipe, wish I'd written it down the first time

## Notes
I have created my own recipes when cooking for a long time, but this was the first baked good that I made on my own without consulting a specific recipe. I have had many Apfelkuchen over the years made in all manner of styles. When I came up with it I was thinking of a cake that a friend of my mother made for a little tea party once. That friend passed away while I was living on the other side of the country, so it's not possible for me to find out her exact recipe anymore. I am getting to an age where I've lost a few people in my life. Eating does not bring me the enjoyment that it used to, but making food still makes me feel close to my grandmother, who was an incredible cook.

## Makes
8 servings

## Requires
8 inch springform pan, greased and floured

## Ingredients
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup honey
2 (? I forget) eggs
1 Tbsp orange juice or apple cider vinegar
1 tsp vanilla extract

1 1/2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp baking soda

1 apple, thinly sliced (any variety that holds up to baking; I like Granny Smith)

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350F

Cream butter and honey together, beat in egg, add orange juice or vinegar, add dry ingredients, pour into 8 inch pan, arrange the apple slices nicely on top in a circle (press them in vertically so that the slice cuts into the cake, like Hasselback potatoes, separated to make a sunburst pattern)

Bake for 45-60 minutes until cake is done
