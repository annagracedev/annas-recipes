    <h1>Clean-Up-The-Fridge Rice</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>The night that I take out the trash is clean-up-the-fridge night. Sometimes I simply eat the leftovers that are reaching the end of their lifespan, and sometimes I cook them into a new dish. I&#8217ve had many interesting clean-up-the-fridge dinners. When I have vegetables and meat to use up, but no starch, this is a good option.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Makes</h2>
    <p>About 2 servings</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup uncooked rice, washed (I prefer jasmine rice for this recipe)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cooked meat, cut into small pieces if necessary</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cooked or quick-cooking vegetables, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
      <li>2 tsp spices (I often use 1 tsp of turmeric and 1 tsp of another spice)</li>
      <li>Water or broth, enough to cover rice by about 1 cm</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pot over medium heat, melt the butter and add the garlic and onion. Cook the alliums until the onion is translucent.</li>
      <li>Add rice and spices. Cook until the rice is dry and toasted and the spices are fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add your meat and vegetables and stir, then add the cooking liquid. Cover, bring to a boil, and turn the heat down to low.</li>
      <li>Cook until all the liquid is absorbed. Let rest for a few minutes and fluff the rice before serving.</li>
    </ol>
