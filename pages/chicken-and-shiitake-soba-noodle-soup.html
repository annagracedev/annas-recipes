    <h1>Chicken and Shiitake Soba Noodle Soup</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Most soba noodles contain about 10% wheat flour to improve the texture, so they are not safe for gluten-free people. I have only found Eden Organics to make soba with 100% buckwheat. I haven&#8217t attempted making fresh soba with buckwheat flour yet.</p>
      <p>Another method of cooking this is to cook the chicken and mushrooms with soy sauce and mirin, then add broth to deglaze. After my first time making it that way I altered it; I think the chicken absorbs enough flavor from the soup.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Makes</h2>
    <p>1 serving</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>250ml shiitake dashi</li>
      <li>2-3 rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>100g chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>2 oz 100% buckwheat soba noodles</li>
      <li>Spring onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Soft-boiled egg, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To make shiitake dashi, rehydrate sun-dried shiitake mushrooms in 500ml water for several hours or overnight. Save the remaining dashi for another recipe.</li>
      <li>Prepare the chicken thighs by trimming and cutting them first into strips with the grain, then into cubes against the grain.</li>
      <li>Cook the chicken thighs with a small amount of oil in a pot over medium heat until they are cooked through and no longer pink.</li>
      <li>Add the dashi, shiitake, soy sauce, and mirin. Bring to a boil for a few minutes to combine the flavors and boil off the alcohol in mirin.</li>
      <li>In another pot, boil the soba noodles for about 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain well.</li>
      <li>Place the noodles in the bottom of a serving bowl and pour the hot soup over them. Garnish with spring onion. Sometimes I cut a soft-boiled egg in half and place it on top.</li>
    </ol>
